I've started to be very meticulous and picky about my code styling a few
months ago. After a nightmare refactoring experience I fully understood
the importance of code styling and patters.

I'm putting a lot of effort in following a common style (see PEP8 below)
and I'm sure there are spaces for improvements (and I have to refactor
some of my old code as well).

Python has an easteregg with some aphorisms written by Tim Peters, you
can read them typing:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import this

This is the result:

.. code-block:: python

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

I suggest to thoroughly read and understand the `PEP 8 style guide for
Python document`_.

Happy styled coding!
